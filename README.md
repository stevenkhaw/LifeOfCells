# LifeOfCells
`LifeOfCells` is a replication of John Conway's Game of Life. It is a cellular automation, zero-player game that evolves determined by its initial state.

## Features
These rules compare the behavior of the automaton to real life:

* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
